# Odin Tic-Tac-Toe

JavaScript exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).

The task was to implement a basic 3x3 2 player tic-tac-toe game. The main purpose of the exercise was to practice the factory function and module patterns. The secondary purpose was to practice separating the application's logic and view.

In addition to the 3x3 version, I also added a 20x20 version where the players have to get 5 consecutive cells in order to win. As a challenge for myself, I tried to solve the problem of checking whether a player has won without looking up the solution. I succeeded, but for this reason, the win condition checking is most probably not the most optimal solution.
